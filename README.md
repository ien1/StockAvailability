# StockAvailability
Model to predict whether a product is in stock or not

Origin:
The GoodsForecast.OSA* system analyzes sales history in a chain of stores and identifies products with the highest probability of being out of stock.
Store employees check the availability of goods and the correctness of the price tag for each item, if necessary, removing products from the warehouse and/or adjusting the price tag.
Thus, we strive to ensure timely detection of the lack of goods on the shelf, so that customers do not miss the opportunity to make a purchase, and the chain increases turnover.
 
*OSA (On Shelf Availability) is an indicator of the presence of products on the store shelf.
